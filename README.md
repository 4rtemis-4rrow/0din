# Odin

Decentralized Federated File Hosting Platform
## Overview

Odin is an early alpha-stage decentralized federated file hosting platform designed to offer a scalable, user-friendly solution for sharing and accessing files across a distributed network. It merges the benefits of decentralization and federation to create a dynamic and resilient file-sharing ecosystem.
## Key Features

Decentralized Hosting: Operates on a distributed network of nodes, each contributing to the overall system, ensuring robustness and redundancy.

Federated Architecture: Nodes communicate and interact seamlessly, enabling users to access files hosted on any participating node.

Admin-Only Uploads: File uploads are restricted to administrators. Uploads are done by manually placing files into designated directories rather than through a web interface.

Automatic Categorization: Files are automatically categorized based on their path and file extension, simplifying file organization and retrieval.

HTTP Access: Files can be accessed via standard HTTP, allowing users to browse and download files using any web browser without the need for specialized clients, unlike torrents.

Ease of Setup: Designed for simplicity, Odin is extremely easy to set up, requiring minimal configuration and maintenance.

## How It Works

Setup: Configure Odin by pointing it to a specific directory on your system. Odin will begin hosting files from this directory immediately.

File Access: Users can search and download files from any node in the network using a standard web browser. The federated design ensures that files are available across the network.

File Management: Administrators manage file uploads by manually placing files into the appropriate directories on their node.

Network Expansion: As more users establish Odin nodes, the network grows, increasing the availability and distribution of files across a broader range.

## Roadmap
### Minor Features

CSS and Multiple Themes: Implementation of customizable CSS and multiple themes to enhance user interface aesthetics.

Wiki and Usage Documentation: Comprehensive wiki and usage documents to assist users in setting up and utilizing Odin effectively.

### Major Features

Admin Panel: Development of a web-based admin panel for easier management and configuration of Odin nodes.

Proxying Nodes: Support for proxying one node over another, which is useful for nodes that cannot directly port forward, allowing for greater flexibility in network setup.

## Status

Odin is currently in early alpha. While the core features are functional, the project is still under development and is not yet ready for production use. We welcome feedback and contributions as we work towards a stable release.
